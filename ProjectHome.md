Phlooder is an easy to use open-source tool to flood phishing databases with useless information.

Phlooder uses the technique called 'duping' or 'scam baiting' which means that it acts like a duped user who wants to share his personal data with the chosen phishing site, hundred times a minute.

Of course all the information given out is random generated so the phisher's evil little script starts to gather huge amounts of useless data, cosuming the phishers resourses and hiding the real 'phishes' with real information.

The project is in development state now, the latest test releases are always to be found in the Downlads section. If you want to add new features to the program or just want to take a look into the soure code, feel free to checkout the Subversion repository and send your changes!
